## Floral Initiation in Apple

In Arabidopsis, the _GIGANTEA_ (_GI_) gene mediates output from a circadian clock and cooperates with light quality (wavelength) to regulate the diurnal expression of _CONSTANS_ (_CO_). CO promotes expression of the _Flowering Locus T_ (_FT_) gene under inductive photoperiods, and, in conjunction with the gibberellin pathway, also activates _SUPPRESSOR OF CONSTANS 1_ (_SOC1_). _SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN-LIKE_ (_SPL_) genes act as promoters of _FT_, _APETALA1_ (_AP1_), and _SOC1_. _SPL_ gene expression is post-transcriptionally repressed by a class of microRNA, MIR156/157, during the very short juvenile-like phase. _FLOWERING LOCUS C_ (_FLC_) represses _FT_ in the absence of vernalizing cold and thus mediates the promotive effects of cold temperatures on flowering (vernalization). FT and SOC1 cooperatively activate _AP1_ and _LEAFY_ (_LFY_) which together direct floral initiation and flower formation. The _TERMINAL FLOWER 1_ (_TFL1_) gene represses _LFY_ in the center of the inflorescence meristem, thus preventing formation of a terminal flower and enabling indeterminate flower formation. In apple, several of the known Arabidopsis flowering genes have clear structural homologs and exhibit conserved function. The goal of my research is to characterize the expression patterning of these homologs and other flowering genes to construct a model of the floral initiation pattern in apple.
