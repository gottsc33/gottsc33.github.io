## Unravelling the Molecular Mechanism of Biennial Bearing in Apple

The tendency to flower and produce a crop only every other year is referred to as biennial or alternate bearing. This trait is mediated at the point of floral initiation, and is characterized by profuse flowering in a given year (the “on” year), followed by minimal flowering the subsequent year (the “off” year). The resulting variability in production creates instabilities in consumer supplies and income for producers, as well as increasing the cost of production. It is generally acknowledged that the presence of developing fruit on spurs inhibits floral initiation within the adjacent bourse shoot. Because apple flowers in a two year cycle, with flowers initiated in the first year and completing development (bloom) in the second year, this inhibition results in lack of flowers and fruit the year following a heavy crop load. Although the phenomenon of biennial bearing has been studied for more than 50 years at the physiological level, there have been few studies at the molecular and genetic levels. The goal of my research is to understand how fruit load interacts with the [floral initation pathway](https://github.com/gottsc33/gottsc33.github.io/blob/master/floral_initiation/index.md).
