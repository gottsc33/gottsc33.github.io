## Evaluation of PGRs for Manipulation of Flowering Traits in Apple

For apple growers, percise control of flowering and flowering-related traits is vital for profitability. The use of plant growth regulators (PGRs) offer an additional tool for growers to potentially manipulate flowering. The application of GA formulations to trees in their “off” year (ie. trees expected to bloom heavily the following year) has potential to reduce or eliminate overcropping and the need for thinning. In addition to GAs, synthetic GA biosynthesis inhibitors have been used in attempts to manipulate flowering. The expectation is that, if GAs repress flowering, compounds that interfere with GA production or response should promote flowering. The application of the GA biosynthesis inhibitor paclobutrazol has shown some promising results. Another GA biosynthesis inhibitor, Daminozide (Alar) has also been used successfully to promote return bloom. However, the use of Alar in apple is now restricted due to its potential as a human carcinogen (EPA 1989). Other plant growth regulators (PGRs) have been found to influence flowering in apple, mostly with inconsistent results. 6-BA, a synthetic cytokinin, hase been trialed in combination with Alar on blooming branches resulting in a significant increase to flowering the subsequent year. Ethephon, a compound that breaks down in plant tissues to produce ethylene, has also been shown to reduced flowering after an off year. However, ethephon also been shown to increased flowering when a low bloom density was expected after an on year. Naphthaleneacetic Acid (NAA), a synthetic auxin, has also been shown to increased return bloom under some conditions but was variable in efficacy over different cultivars and application intervals. My research has been focused on determining the efficacy of these chemcials along with others in manupliating flowering. I am also investigating what concentrations, application timings, and chemical combinations that can be used to increase the effectiveness.
