# Welcome to the USDA ARS Pear Scion Breeding Program

## Current Aims
  1. Maintain and develop new resistance to [Fire Bight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_blight) and [Pear Psylla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psylla_pyri)
  2. Enhance germplasm for fruit quality traits including flavor, aroma, texture, appearance, and novelty traits
  3. Bred for scion tree form that is better suited for moderate to high-density training systems.
  4. Improve post-harvest and supply-chain resilience
