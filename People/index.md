## Christopher (Chris) Gottschalk (he/him/his)

I joined the USDA ARS in January of 2021 to create a new pome fruit genetics laboratory. My program represents a merging of two previous laboratories that featured the historical USDA Pear Scion breeding program and an apple pathology improvement program. Prior to joining ARS I was a graduate student in the [van Nocker molecular genetics lab in the Dept. of Horticulture at Michigan State University](https://www.canr.msu.edu/people/dr_steve_van_nocker). My graduate research included elucidating the genetic mechanisms responsible for fruit load mediated floral repression (AKA biennial or alternate bearing) in apple, evaluating the efficacy of plant growth regulator use in controlling aspects of flowering in apple, development of _Malus_ genomic resources, establishment of the [Great Lakes Cider Apple Collection](https://ciderapples.msu.edu/), and evaluation of red-fleshed apple populations.
