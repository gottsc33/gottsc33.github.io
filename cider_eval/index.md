## Evaluation of Red-Fleshed and Cider Apples for Hard Cider Production

Separate from my flowering-related research, I also established a research program focused on cultivar evaluation for hard cider production in Michigan. Here, I have successfully secured funding for the establishment of the Great Lakes Cider Apple Collection. This collection serves as a large-scale replicated variety trial, in which more than 60 cider apple cultivars are being evaluated across five different locations, encompassing most of Michigan’s agricultural regions. My cider-related research has also produced a multitude of extension-related materials including a published bulletin and variety trial, an [extension resource website](https://ciderapples.msu.edu/), and a cider apple trait database.
