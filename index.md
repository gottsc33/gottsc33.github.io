### Chris Gottschalk's Research Webpage

I am a fifth year PhD candidate in [Steve van Nocker's developmental genetics lab](https://www.canr.msu.edu/people/dr_steve_van_nocker) in the [Department of Horticulture at Michigan State University](https://www.canr.msu.edu/hrt/). My dissertation research is primarily focused on deciphering the molecular mechanisms that control flowering traits in apple. My dissertation’s pinnacle project is the thorough assembly and characterization of a high-resolution transcriptome of the shoot apical meristem, during floral initiation and development in the high-value cultivar ‘Honeycrisp’. This project also is investigating how fruit load interacts with the flowering pathway in regards to expanding our understanding of the genetic mechanisms underlying biennial bearing tendency. Complementary to that project, I assembled a transcriptome that documented the response to exogenous Gibberellin application (a repressor of flowering) in the apex of the annual-bearing cultivar ‘Gala’ during the period of floral initiation. Both projects implicated a central role that a homolog of the gene TERMINAL FLOWER 1 has in repressing flowering. All of my flowering research has led me to participate in an exciting collaborative study documenting the anatomical and molecular basis of spring bloom times in apple and its wild relatives.
