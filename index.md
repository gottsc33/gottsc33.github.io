## Chris Gottschalk's Research Page

I am a fifth year PhD candidate in [Steve van Nocker's developmental genetics lab](https://www.canr.msu.edu/people/dr_steve_van_nocker) in the Department of Horticulture at Michigan State University. My disseration is focused on understanding the molecular mechanisms that underlie flowering in apple trees and how fruit load intersects with this pathway. My interest in apples began during my undergraduate degree, BSc Plant Biology, at Michigan State when I began working with Steve van Nocker on a undergraduate thesis. During this time I was introduced to the vast genetic diversity in apples and how this drives the extreme phenotypic diversity that can be observed. Ultimately, this lead be back to MSU to continue with my graduate education.

My current research endeavors are quite diverse and include the following key focus areas:

-Genetic mechanism for floral initiation in apple
-Effect of fruit load on floral initiation (biennial bearing)
-Regulation of flowering through plant growth regulator application
-Marker-assisted selection of new red-juice and cider cultivars
-Evaluation of existing apple cultivars: red-fleshed/juice and cider
-Genetic diversity of _Malus_ species, hybrids, and cultivars

Below are respositorys for the various genomic resources I have assembled from my various works:
